# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Instructions:
[app hosted in Heroku](https://afternoon-gorge-22266.herokuapp.com/)

or

1. The code code to clean and model the data used is hosted in a Jupyter notebook instead of a series of scripts.  This is partially because the notebook provides a sort of 'appendix' to the app which is rather simple.

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.  Since this is a Dash app I believe that the normal port used is 8080 for local machines. By default the app is set to run smoothly with heroku, port 5000
    `python run.py 8080`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:8080/



# Folders and files included:

* **app**:
	* **run.py**:  This will use several exports from the Starbucks_full_documentation.ipynb to create a visualization of the final results from that notebook.  
	* **df_combo_format.png**, **diff_df_exp_styler.png**, **diff_df_styler.png**:  These are images of pd.style object created in Starbucks_full_documentation.   They are imported as images because the style objects can't be rendered in Dash, and these are available in their full format in the .ipynb.
* **data**:  
	* **offer_info.csv**: This file contains a matrix linking offer_ids to their prominent characteristics
	* **portfolio.json**:  contains offer information, reward amount, duration and difficulty (from Udacity Data Science Nanodegree)
	* **profile.json**: contains person information (from UDSN) 
	* **transcript.json**: contains information on transactions, time.
  
* **models**: 
	* **Starbucks_full_documentation.ipynb**: This file contains code to clean the data, do initial regression models, and then implement FunkSVD and chi-square
	* **diff_df_exp_sc.csv**, **diff_df_sc.csv**: This contains the difference between observed and expected values for user item matrices, grouped by demographic categories, in a matrix format.  Each file is for a different type of FunkSVD.
	* **output_funksvd.csv**, **output_funksvd.csv**, these contain the u + v matrix stacked upon each other 

# Current Requirements:
see requirements.txt

# Results:
  
Unique combinations were found associated with each demographic group. Discounts were more effective with people who were younger, lower income, and/or male.  Older, higher income people were overrepresented in bogo orders.

# Discussion/Notes:

There were several complexities of this analysis worth discussing (some are further elaborated in the notebook).  First of all, there was the challenge of determining offer impact, for which we used the ratio of reward used to money spent. Additionally, we made no attempt to account for all the possible interaction effects generated by this demographic data.  If one specific population of interest it would be worth putting these to more rigorous statistical analyses.
